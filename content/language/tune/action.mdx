Actions are words that describe what someone or something is doing,
often shown as verbs. For example, in the sentence "She runs every
morning," the word "runs" is the action, telling us what she does each
day. Actions are the "doing" words in sentences.

These are verbs. Here are a few foundational ones.

### Gerunds

Gerunds are words that look like verbs but function as nouns. They end
in <Whole>"-ing"</Whole> and can be used to describe activities or
actions, like "swimming" in "Swimming is fun." In this example,
"swimming" acts as a noun, just like "fun."

| type                  | phrase | example                        |
| :-------------------- | :----- | :----------------------------- |
| subject               | reC x  | Eating an apple is cool.       |
| object                | reC x  | I love eating apples.          |
| object of preposition | reC x  | I am excited by eating apples. |
