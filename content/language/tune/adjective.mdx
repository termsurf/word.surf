So we have a few examples:

| call                 | meaning         |
| :------------------- | :-------------- |
| bram                 | creation        |
| bram yog             | creationism     |
| sup bram             | created (past)  |
| dax bram             | created (state) |
| reC bram             | creating        |
| wid bram             | will create     |
| bram yog zek         | creationist     |
| yas bram yog zek     | creationists    |
| bak bram yog zek     | creationist's   |
| bak yas bram yog zek | creationists'   |

What is a modifier depends on what you are saying. In the above, `bram`
is sometimes a modifier and sometimes the base.

And some example sentences.

You can include the `-u` on designs if it helps scope concepts into
their own nested terms, or you can leave it out. Whatever helps with
comprehension. You can even put designs after the base word, by adding a
`-u`, though it is unusual.

## Talking modifiers

In one way, you can learn about modifiers as ways of accomplishing
common things you do in English with prefixes, suffixes, and sometimes
extra words.

### To say "more"

To say "better", you say essentially "more good". To say "wiser", you
say "more wise". That is like "mor tov" or "mor wix". Since this becomes
basically an adjective (or like we call a feature, or more specifically
a "fusion"), it ends in `-u` if anything. So "mor tovu" or "mor wixu".

### To say "most"

To say "best", you say "most good". To say "wisest", "most wise", etc..
So "mis tov" and "mis wix". These are nouns, so they end in `-a`, like
"mis tova".

### To say "-ly"

When you say words like "creatively" or "natively" or "shockingly", you
are basically saying "like" or "emanating" or "oriented", each of which
are slightly different ways of capturing meaning (which English doesn't
dig into).

So you would say "creative-emanating", as "bram netu". The system for
doing like is like "creative-like" or "bram muzu".

### To say "-ing", but not in the progressive tense (i.e. as Gerunds)

To say "shockingly", the "-ing" is meaning "inducing", so "shock
inducing like". To do that, you would do "zor", so "samlar zor muzu". It
has no definite progression or state, it is just a nebulous statement.

### To say "-ing", as an activity

To say "I was eating", you would say "suqa vut reC hiti".

### To say "-ed"

There are 2 types of `-ed`, a state which is entered into, or a
completed action. The completed action you do with "yod", so to say "I
walked yesterday", you might say "yod waki". But to say "I am angered",
that is an entered into state, that is you now contain that state, so
that would be with "pot" as in "pot kadibu".

### To say "-able"

To say "convertible", you would say "hawal kanu".

### To say "-ful"

To say "beautiful" you would use "fol" like "fol byutu".

### To say "-less"

To say "careless" you would use "lef", "lef hudumu".

### To say "-some"

Like "awesome", you would say "hasom tazu".

### Other Examples

- interestingly = interest + ing + ly, so "trise".
- interestingly enough = "tris nufe" (you can leave off the `-e` if it
  isn't necessary)
- mystification = mystery + ify + ication, so "the make mystery
  process", or "mek kix rahasa"
- centrality = central + ity, means roughly "central orientedness", that
  is, the nature of having centralness, so that would be "van yum noda"
