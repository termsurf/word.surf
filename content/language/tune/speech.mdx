## First Words

First words combine sounds in a meaningful way. Just as the 3 basic
vowels go on to mean very complex things (directions, movement,
feelings, positions, goals, purposes, etc.), so to the various
consonants and other vowels get _associated_ with various complex
meanings. These complex meanings then get chained together into words.

Somewhere, someone would have maybe come up with a set of constraints on
how these sounds could be combined. One such possible _simple_ rule
would be, all sound sequences must start and end with a consonant. This
might have come after people made words be any sequence of sounds,
because any sequence of sounds (which represent rich experiences not
even distinguished between actions and objects) would have quickly run
into the problem of how to distinguish actions and objects. It is more
likely that the experience was given a word, and later we had to mark
the experiences as actions and objects. So in this sliver of experience,
perhaps they came up with this constraint, that words started and ended
with a consonant, _so that_ you could convert them into actions and
objects with a vowel suffix.

So this person would have been born where there were already words, but
the words didn't have a consistent pattern to them. So they changed the
words to have a consistent pattern, which simplified cognitive load.

```
rak r a k
```

The word for "rock" could symbolize the strength/effort "r" required to
lift that rock, the "a" meaning to release the effort and get back to
normal, and the "k", the sound of the rock chipping, or hitting other
rocks.

```
mam m a m
```

The sound `m` would have been for a good thing, as opposed to "n" for a
bad thing. The sound sequence `mam` for "source" (like your mom), would
have been a "good relaxing good" or "good safe good".

But then words would be created out of the feeling of the moment,
whatever _felt right_, and you would end up with words for which the
original meaning was not obvious, or was never obvious. They would get
shared, and normalized, as long as they fit the pattern/rule of
starting/ending with a consonant. Then we can easily tell what is a
"word" and what is not a "word".

The words `kiq` (action type) and `kaq` (object type) represent the
creation, where `q` is neither good nor bad, it just _is_, as peace.
"The creation that moves forward, and is", and "the creation that stands
still, and is", `k-i-q`, and `k-a-q`.

The sound `f` might be associated with the wind or cold.

The sound `x` with a splashing of a stream or water.

The sound `s` with a flowing stream.

That is why the "universe" is "six", the stream that moves forward with
turbulence.

A "name" is `nem`, a "bad featuring good". It is a bad thing, but it has
some good to it. Not all words can be defined like this, but some were
defined like this.

## Distinguishing Actions and Objects

At first the action and object marker come separated from the main word.

```
I need food
suq a sod i fud a
```

Then it becomes suffixed.

```
suqa sodi fudi
```

You notice that words can't end in `w`, `y`, or `h`, because they don't
make a distinct enough sound. Also don't start with `q`, because that is
a hard sound to start with.

## Counting

Counting are among the first words.

1. pointer finger
2. middle finger
3. ring finger
4. pinky finger
5. thumb

Thumb, being `-u`, points back to self, going deep inside. Pointer,
being `-i`, points out into the world.

The closed fist is zero, so zero wasn't that hard of a concept.

We could lay down leaves for every 10. And sticks for every 100. And
rocks for every 1000. Otherwise with our fingers we can show 0-10.

We can learn to say "more" or "less" than 1000, or "much more" or "much
less" than 1000, rather than having to be exact.

However, much is basically a modifier without a clear noun or verb base.
More and less are relationship invoking words, so they define properties
like adjectives.

Much could represent "much stuff", where you stretch your arms out, hold
a pile of branches. "Few" you would hold just a handful of branches.

To express "more stuff" and "less" stuff, that is in relation to
something else. So have to talk about the relationship, with "than".
"More stuff than this". "Less stuff than this".

Than comes from compare (`Can`), but as a preposition `Canu`.

## Conjunctions

Conjunction words are among the first words too, to make bigger
sentences.

- and: comes from "bind"
- or: comes from "choice"
- not: comes from "void"
- but: comes from "exception"
