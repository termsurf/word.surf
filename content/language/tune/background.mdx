In our forray into the rules of Tune, we will cover first our basic
notion of experience, upon which the spirits (base words) are based.
This is important, to understand the deep meaning early words might have
had on monkeys and ultimately humans. They didn't just quickly learn all
of language and how to speak like we do just over night, they felt the
meaning of each _sound_, it was a new medium. Each sound was sacred,
each sound was met with intensity and passion. It stirred in the ancient
monkeys a huge drive to understand, listening to the sounds others made,
and what they meant by it. They learned a lot just by listening and
observing, not talking back in an unreflective banter. They reflected.
Looked back on.

```
luk bak rik
```

Oooh, what do they mean by that? Luk! Look at the patterns. Bak! Look
over what you've already looked over before. And then look over it
again! On it, flowing and traversing over the past. They reflected and
they learned.

```
luban.
lujban.
lojban.
```

```
loan joke bond.
```

The monkeys would find patterns in what others had said. And build a
language out of those patterns.

This would lead to the hypothesis that modern language is a dumbing down
of knowledge and participation by the community. It would lead to the
hypothesis that we were bread to be dull-minded so that we can make
tools in the physical world to help us become more automated. So that
would lead to a possible hypthesis that the flood story was a flood of
not confusion but ignoration. The spreading of ignorance on purpose to
dumb us down.

So those would have to be tested for.

So the monkeys felt each sound. They let it resonate in their souls.
They experienced each sound and felt it in their bodies. They would then
seek out the meaning of such a sound, and learn to communicate with each
other on a deeper level.

So monkeys would be communicating at a deeper level than before. They
would have said stuff like:

```
r
a
k
s
u
q
l
a
v
r
i
m
```

That would be _you_. I love _you_. And you point and point after saying
that, and you demonstrate it with actions. You observe and absorb the
feelings of your close ones, the one's who will deliver the message
straight to you. The ones who you spend time with the most. And you
experience these words.

At first, using the vowels and consonants is like painting with a
paintbrush your inner experiences. People can read from you your inner
experience, by creating a shared set of sound sequences that we all
remember. These sound sequences become realized to be words at some
point, and then we begin thinking more abstractly.

So we create the rules for the language. And that is what you see here
today.

- 3 key open mouth sounds. The 3-valued feeling game.
- 3 key closed mouth sounds. Good, bad, neutral.
- 6 additional drum sounds.
- 1 silent sound.
- sfvzjxcC: 8 leg sounds (s = left thigh, f = right thigh, v = right
  knee, z = left knee, down to shin and ankle)
- 4 feet sounds.
- Feed back into the 5 key open mouth sounds, by weaving e and o through
  the ears.
- 27 cube.

Making sounds with a disco ball basically. Partying in up. Making beats,
living a vibrant life.

This may have become like music and rhythm and dancing, and eventually
possibly chanting experiences through sound sequences. These would
become like the first words.

```
g
a
d
a
b
u
m
```

So perhaps these longer words were the first words to be created. But
then they got summed down and filtered down to the bare essence of it,
which is where we get the 3-10 letter 1-2 syllable words. The longer
words fell something up, they provide you with a deep experience which
you have to unpack, which you can just experience through raw emotion by
unpacking each sound in a sequence in the environment.

```
b
a
d
a
b
i
q
```

> Cha-ching, that is the right answer.

```
b
u
m
b
r
a
t
```

> Feel the beat, feel it hit.

```
g
u
d
c
i
q
k
i
q
```

Then.

```
gud ciq kiq
```

Good thing king. What does this mean? We observe like the ancient
would've, pondered the meaning in depth.

```
b
y
u
t
i
f
u
l
w
o
r
k
```

Vertical writing, seeing it written down would be how it's maybe done.

So then they observe and observe, until they end at thinking in terms of
words.

Somehow they develop models for things.

## Today

The language is here to guide you back into the grass where we used to
play. The rocks where we used to sit and chissel for all day every day
for long swaths of time. The language will never be truly finished, it
will be an exploration into the infinite memory. A ricochet and
absorption of wisdom and experience from the oneness. As we fine tune
our bond, we see the beauty of the universe. So we keep refining and
chiseling away until we create a tool to navigate the oneness. Such a
tool will be like a seed to the mind's eye, and reunite us with the
unity. The trees will bloom and perfection will be achieved. As long as
we keep unifying with the oneness, breaking it down, and finding the
secret behind how things act.

We use the scientific method where appropriate, and otherwise resort
back to logical reasoning given a fuzzy and incomplete view of facts. We
determine what goes into the puzzle and what works horribly. We decide
on paths forward and refine our understanding of the unity.

Unity lives in part through the differences we each portray in our
lives. So be unique, bathe in the fountain, ride on the spiral of our
divinity and yet still be a human[^tool].

The initial terms are there as an entrypoint into conversation and
exploration, so we can refine them until they are pieces of gold
themselves, spiritually. Ideally we should land on a small set of terms
which can be expanded to several hundreds of thousands of ideas. These
100-500k ideas will allow us talk about things on all edges in an
unlimited number of sentences. Not one person could learn the entire
thing, it would be just beyond grasp, the level of depth we could go in
various realms of knowledge and human experience. So we get to tens of
millions of experiences in a lifetime. But at the same time, have and
remember the seed to get back to the oneness.

Experience life to the fullest potential, while remembering where you
came from and where you are going.

Embrace the powerful, bathe in the fountain, lose youself between the
sounds. Keep going.
