Here we will describe the key word formation rules. First, some major
things we can get out of the way up front.

- All base word forms start and end with a consonant. They are turned
  into words which represent actions, objects, and features by adding
  vowels to the end.
- Word components can't end in `h`, `y`, or `w`, as these don't really
  make a clear audible sound to a non-native speaker.
- Words components can't start in `q` (-ng sound).
- Words can't start with `xr`, `xl`, or `xn` because they are too hard
  to pronounce.
- There can only be one vowel between consonants. That is, there are not
  sounds like `oi` and `ao`.
- An `h` can't be directly before or after another consonant, it must
  stand alone. So instead of `krahsin` it would just be `krasin` or
  `krahin`.
- The `sh` sound in English is represented with `x`.
- The `ch` sound in English is represented with `tx`.
- The `th` sound in English can be in two forms, "theory" (soft `th`)
  which is a lowercase `c`, and `these` (heavy `th`) which is a capital
  `C`.
- The `j` sound in English is represented with `dj`.
- The `j` in Tune is the sound of "s" in "measure".
- The letter `y` is not treated as a vowel.
- There are no "compound" words composed by joining two or more words
  together.
- "Terms" are multiple words.
- Words can't have `yi` or `ye` (`y` followed by `i` or `e`) in the
  middle.

When a word is based on a trait or adjective, then you can make it a
noun as if you were saying "\[trait\] thing", like "great thing", by
appending the `-a`.

When a word is based on an action or verb, then you can make it into a
noun by thinking "\[verb\] thing", like "stumble thing" is "a stumble",
for the action "to stumble". Sometimes also "\[verb\] result".

When a word is based in an object or noun, there is no need to make it
into a trait, you can just use it without the suffix to mean a trait.

When a word is based in an object or noun, you can make it into a verb
by thinking "make \[noun\]" a lot of the time, as in "cube", to "make
cube" is the verb "to cube". Or to "be \[noun\]".

Words have a single _main_ form, either being an action (verb) or object
(noun). However, it can also be used as a _modifier_ on a noun or a
verb, that is using it in its _base_ form.

Many words are derived from existing languages, such as Chiense, Arabic,
Hebrew, Sanskrit, and English, and even some words from Inuktitut,
French, Latin, and Spanish.

We have worked on making sure each word is maximally different from
every other word, or at least it is mor than one similar consonant away
from every other word.
