Here you will find everything you need to know about how to read and
speak Tune. There is not much to it, just a few types of words that we
string together into sentences, and a few rules for what sounds can be
strung together into words.

{/* <Note text="You can click on any word's fancy script to have it read aloud." /> */}

In Tune, everything begins with "spirits" or "base words", and we add
one of the 3 possible _endings_ to each base word to turn it into one of
the 3 types of spirits:

|  #  | spirit | tone                                             | read | ending | meaning                                                                         |
| :-: | :----- | :----------------------------------------------- | :--- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  1  | action | <T value="kiq" script="tone" processor="tone" /> | kiq  | -i     | These deal with actions which change things in the conversation.                |
|  2  | object | <T value="kaq" script="tone" processor="tone" /> | kaq  | -a     | These deal with the things in the conversation, whether tangible or intangible. |
|  3  | design | <T value="kuq" script="tone" processor="tone" /> | kuq  | -u     | These deal with the _features_ of things, such as their properties.             |

Each spirit or base word starts and ends with a consonant, and is
usually 1 or 2 syllables, though it can be 3 or more in specialized
fields. See the [terms](/term) pages for some examples if you'd like to
jump ahead, but here is a spectrum of base words to demonstrate these
features.

| tone                                                  | read     | meaning    |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :--------- |
| <T script="tone" processor="tone" value="siz" />      | siz      | experience |
| <T script="tone" processor="tone" value="sorn" />     | sorn     | sun        |
| <T script="tone" processor="tone" value="simat" />    | simat    | symmetry   |
| <T script="tone" processor="tone" value="datsul" />   | datsul   | sculpture  |
| <T script="tone" processor="tone" value="djinzit" />  | djinzit  | pyramid    |
| <T script="tone" processor="tone" value="txeqtxik" /> | txeqtxik | hierarchy  |

Now we will dive into subsections focusing on various aspects of the
