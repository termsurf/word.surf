## Overview

You can at first have simple statements, and simple sentences with one
action each, and otherwise objects. The actions end in `-i` and the
objects in `-a`.

It is often the case you want to apply a frame of reference to the
conversation. The "apply x" is for applying to the context of the
conversation. It sets the "frame of reference". So for frame setting, we
add `-u`. It is the inside, where things are coming from, the source,
the "cradle".

Logical conjunctions are such "cradles" which allow you to say longer
things without repeating yourself. For "and", it says the cradle is
"bind", so you bind the previous with the next. It is not an action, but
a frame of reference adjustment call, with some content.

Along with conjugations, you can isolate features from nouns and verbs,
to get adjectives and adverbs, like "black" and "quick". Then you can
talk about the features themselves. To distinguish these, at first you
end the noun phrase with "design" (aka "feature" or "trait") suffixes,
one for objects and one for actions. The `-e` for action designs, and
`-o` for object designs.

Then after you have these 5 types of parts of speech, you can _optimize_
by defining more grammatically useful words. This is done by creating
more cradles. The cradles are the key to simplifying the creation of
streams or flows of words. To create more cradles, you can simply borrow
from existing base words and append the `-u`.

So these are the 5 word types, deriving from the two base experience
types, deriving from the oneness, raw experience.

## Experience

Everything is experience, `siz`. From the experience we identify and
label actions and objects, `siq` and `saq`, as `kiq` and `kaq`. We chain
them together to gather and share wisdom, just like we do with the
fruits of our harvest. We sit and absorb each word slowly, to experience
each presence. It is an object or an action, moving us forward or
standing before us.

We can work on primitive language constructs by only chanting using
manners, and visualizing them deeply in their fullness. We can suffix
these raw, direct experiences with object or action suffixes so we focus
attention into a flow from one state to the next. This is a second level
of communication beyond the manner chanting.

The things that move us and pull us into the next step are the `i`.

The things that are right before us are the things, the `a`. It is as if
they are the structures that stand still amongst us.

There are the two.

So they go from broad experiences to specific experiences, to actions
and objects of experience.

1. Individual mark-less words. Vocal expressions.
2. Chained mark-less words. Focusing on the experience they invoke. Play
   games with words.
3. Chained marked words. Hearing the words as a weaving of actions and
   objects.
4. Longer chains to form basic complex sentences. Chat. Sentence
   patterns.
5. Meta word expansion. Full conceptual model.
6. Chat-based learning and refinement.

It starts with the base experience words. The experience words are
chained together without inflection. Then the 5 suffixes are added to
allow for fluid sentences.

## Stages of Evolution

We start with simply stating one word at a time. Perhaps starting with
one syllable, maybe more syllables, but each representing a rich
experience.

Then we subdivide this experience into two main classes, so we can
describe _actions_ to take place on _objects_ more specifically than
just invoking the memory of a rich experience.

At some point we develop the ability to connect two nouns with a verb in
between, to signify an action.

```
we hunt deer
we eat deer
```

Sort of as commands or statements about reality. With these basic
"sentences", we get the following advantages:

- Sharing information with others.
- Memorizing action plans ourselves.

These can then evolve the ability to take default arguments, meaning the
listener is the first argument:

```
hunt deer (literally you hunt deer)
```

This can then evolve to take modifiers on the nouns (still all
object/action words).

```
we hunt man deer
```

To get to this level of complexity (i.e. more than 3 words as
noun-verb-noun), we would need to possibly start _marking_ the words as
to what part of speech they were, because some words could mean both an
action and an object depending on how you look at it. For example,
"hit", is it the hit itself or the action of hitting? So we mark actions
with `-i` and objects with `-a`.

```
we   hunt  man deer
pema hanti maf djira
```

Then we add conjunctions, but since they are about the word sequencing
itself, they become a new class.

```
we   hunt  man deer  and  eat  it
pema hanti maf djira kon  hiti vala
```

Then we add adjectives and adverbs, what we learn as the shared
"features" which objects and actions share.

```
we   see  black and  white
pema visi vego  kon  wato

we   hunt  big   man  deer  and  calmly eat  it
pema hanti brato mafo djira kon  klam   hiti vala
```

But we can borrow our existing pattern of using word order to simplify,
and reomve the need to include the `-o` endings on adjectives/modifiers,
and `-e` endings on adverbs, if they come directly before the object or
action.

```
we   hunt  big  man deer  and  calmly eat  it
pema hanti brat maf djira kon  klam   hiti vala
```

We can evolve words, plucking content words from our noun/verb/adjective
pile and make them into "prepositions". "And" itself is plucked from the
word "bind". Likewise, we have actions for many of English's
prepositions, like "on" comes from "to on something", an action
signifying the experience of being on something.

```
we   climb up   trees
pema kimi  riku yas dipa
```

And in addition, we gain other words like English's "determiners" like
"the" and "a". These focus attention on the context of the conversation,
offering some kind of scope to what is being said. These scopes only
take one argument, what is to follow, so we then also omit their ending.

```
we   climb up   the tree
pema kimi  riku dan dipa
```

So sometimes the suffix can be left off, when we follow word-ordering
conventions. This simplifies the language.

But someone could have come up with this small set of rules in one
lifetime. Then language flourishes from there.

So the question is, what are some hypothetical "rite of passage"
experiences which could reveal to you these patterns:

1. That everything is an experience, creating the "manner" words.
2. That experience can be divided into actions and objects, creating
   these 2 classes of words.
3. That actions and objects can be said to have particular features,
   creating the design words.
4. That you can have words which modify the word stream (like "and") by
   creating cradle words.
5. That you can further modify the stream by making cradle words from
   existing action and object words.

With these 5 or so rules, you could invent a language. You would just
have to see them in your mind's eye first. Perhaps it could be done
after having a rich lexicon of experiential words, then realizing that
you could disambiguate and become clearer by marking which was the
action and which was the object. Then adding additional markers for the
other kinds of speech, for 5 total kinds.

They would just have to sit down and come up with names of things using
this system. Could this system be taught to adults? It could be taught
to children of the next generation.

## Teaching the words "action" and "object"

Have several action words, such as "run", "walk", "sleep", etc.. Have
several object words "leg", "hand", "head", etc.. Say the action words,
and after each, "action". Say the object words, and after each,
"object".

Point your two fingers, on the left hand is "a" representing "object",
and on your right hand "i" representing "action". Play a game to
recognize which is which. Raise your left pointer finger if an object,
your right if it's an action.

## Teaching the word "experience"

Unite the two words for action and object into one, bringing your two
fingers together. Say each object and action word like "run" and "leg"
and say "experience".

Radiate your hands outwards and say "experience", signifying everything
is an experience.

## Teaching the word "word"

## Teaching the word "feature"

Show two black things and two brown things. End them with `-o`, then
point to the `o` sound and say "object feature".

```
brown rock
cov   raka

brown stick
cov   stika

black rock
veg   raka

black stick
veg   stika

covo
vego

o

laqa

o

laqa
```

Show fast wave and fast breathe, and slow wave and slow breathe.

```
wave quickly
fast wevi

wave slowly
slom wevi

breathe quickly
fast raci

breathe slowly
slom raci

faste
slome

e

liqa

e

liqa
```

Then show the relationship.

```
boc laq saq
boc liq siq
```

Then show the name for both:

```
liq kaq saz
laq kaq saz
```
