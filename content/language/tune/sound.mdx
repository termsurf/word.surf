With all that said, now we will outline the sounds we use in Tone in
more detail so you know what to expect and how to write the words on a
typical keyboard in ASCII. This is the "phonology". Then we will go into
some of the standard concepts in the form of words. Finally, we will
show some fundamental sentence structures.

First, we need to know how to actually write the words in Tune, and what
sounds we can even use to make words in the first place! That is the
writing system and "phonology" (sound study).

All sounds and pronunciations are written in simple ASCII using
[Read Text](https://github.com/termsurf/read), but the Read Text letters
are introduced next to IPA letters, in case you are already familiar
with IPA. Read Text is a system we have devised for writing the
_pronunciation_ of words using only letters you have on your traditional
laptop keyboard. We use only a small subset of the aspectes of Read Text
in Tune, because Tune is designed as a language to only use the
"fundamental" sounds, and it turns out to map nicely to the lettering
system of Read Text. Take a look at that Read Text link, it describes in
much more detail what call script is all about and how it works, if you
are interested. However, we will give you just the pieces of it you need
to know about right here as well.

Here, we will write the consonants and vowels we use in Tune, which is
using Read Text, and will write a word next to each letter to show the
key sound that the letter represents. After reading through these, you
should know how to write a pronunciation using your keyboard. That is,
you can write a word in Tune, which inherently includes how to pronounce
it! Then you can use the ToneEtch font to render it using Tone Text, if
desired.

## Consonants

In Tune, there are 22 **consonants** used. They are:

|      tone      | read | ipa | the way it sounds                                 |
| :------------: | :--: | :-: | :------------------------------------------------ |
| <T text="m" /> |  m   |  m  | "mark"                                            |
| <T text="n" /> |  n   |  n  | "note"                                            |
| <T text="q" /> |  q   |  ŋ  | "sing", the `-ng` sound                           |
| <T text="g" /> |  g   |  ɡ  | "gift"                                            |
| <T text="d" /> |  d   |  d  | "deed"                                            |
| <T text="b" /> |  b   |  b  | "band"                                            |
| <T text="p" /> |  p   |  p  | "play"                                            |
| <T text="t" /> |  t   |  t  | "time"                                            |
| <T text="k" /> |  k   |  k  | "king"                                            |
| <T text="h" /> |  h   |  h  | "heal"                                            |
| <T text="s" /> |  s   |  s  | "soul"                                            |
| <T text="f" /> |  f   |  f  | "fire"                                            |
| <T text="v" /> |  v   |  v  | "vibe"                                            |
| <T text="z" /> |  z   |  z  | "zone"                                            |
| <T text="j" /> |  j   |  ʒ  | "measure", the "s" sound here, "zh"               |
| <T text="x" /> |  x   |  ʃ  | "ship", the "sh" sound                            |
| <T text="c" /> |  c   |  θ  | "thor", the voiceless "th" sound                  |
| <T text="C" /> |  C   |  ð  | "this", the voiced "th" sound                     |
| <T text="w" /> |  w   |  w  | "wave"                                            |
| <T text="l" /> |  l   |  l  | "love"                                            |
| <T text="r" /> |  r   |  r  | "rise" but with spanish, arabic, or indian accent |
| <T text="y" /> |  y   |  j  | "yard"                                            |

The consonants that are missing (i.e. that Tune does not use) are things
like the Hebrew/Arabic harsh "h" sound, the ejective (hard) consonants
like in Georgian, the stop consonants like in Korean, the French
guttural "r", or the click sounds like in some African languages.

Tune also doesn't have the idea of modified sounds (such as with
aspiration, glottalization, or palatalization), or "long consonants".

## Vowels

Then we have the **vowels**. There are 5 vowels used in Tune. They are:

|      tone      | read | ipa | the way it sounds |
| :------------: | :--: | :-: | :---------------- |
| <T text="i" /> |  i   |  i  | "seat"            |
| <T text="e" /> |  e   |  e  | "make"            |
| <T text="a" /> |  a   |  a  | "call"            |
| <T text="o" /> |  o   |  o  | "hold"            |
| <T text="u" /> |  u   |  u  | "tool"            |

We have left out as many as 10 or more vowel sounds used by various
other languages, focusing only on these extremely distinct vowel sounds.
You can find those left out sounds by looking at
[Tone](https://tone.land).

## Gematria

In the end, we have 22 consonants and 5 vowels, for a total of 27
sounds. This is the same number of letters as the Hebrew alphabet. Here
is the alphabetical order. 27 is the number of blocks in a 3D cube. So
the first layer in from is the lowest number, and the back layer in back
is the highest number, starting from top left and moving right then
down.

```
i e a - d b p - z j x
o u m - t k h - c C w
n q g - s f v - l r y
```

| tone           | read | value |
| :------------- | :--- | :---- |
| <T text="i" /> | i    | 1     |
| <T text="e" /> | e    | 2     |
| <T text="a" /> | a    | 3     |
| <T text="o" /> | o    | 4     |
| <T text="u" /> | u    | 5     |
| <T text="m" /> | m    | 6     |
| <T text="n" /> | n    | 7     |
| <T text="q" /> | q    | 8     |
| <T text="g" /> | g    | 9     |
| <T text="d" /> | d    | 10    |
| <T text="b" /> | b    | 20    |
| <T text="p" /> | p    | 30    |
| <T text="t" /> | t    | 40    |
| <T text="k" /> | k    | 50    |
| <T text="h" /> | h    | 60    |
| <T text="s" /> | s    | 70    |
| <T text="f" /> | f    | 80    |
| <T text="v" /> | v    | 90    |
| <T text="z" /> | z    | 100   |
| <T text="j" /> | j    | 200   |
| <T text="x" /> | x    | 300   |
| <T text="c" /> | c    | 400   |
| <T text="C" /> | C    | 500   |
| <T text="w" /> | w    | 600   |
| <T text="l" /> | l    | 700   |
| <T text="r" /> | r    | 800   |
| <T text="y" /> | y    | 900   |

This is similar to the Hebrew gematria system where the highest number
is 900 as well, and it increments similarly.

Because of the cube, we can play a game of words or animals or sounds.

This is so it flows nicely into the positions of the cube! There are 27
sounds, and 27 slots in a cube.
