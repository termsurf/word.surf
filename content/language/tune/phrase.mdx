In Tune, there are 5 main types of _realized_ [words](/word).

But when you are speaking, any "modifiers" to one of the 5 realized word
forms don't get a prefix either, so they serve as the nebulous base,
which gains meaning through context.

In addition, there is a strict word order for phrases. Action phrases,
object phrases, and manner phrases are such that all modifiers precede
the main "head", as a "tail". The tail words get no suffixes, but the
head gets its appropriate suffix.

In a sense, the head words divide up the sentence like points in a
string, and the hanging part of the string are the modifiers. You can
sequence together things like the following:

| sequence             | example               |
| :------------------- | :-------------------- |
| object-action        | I love                |
| object-action-object | I love stuff          |
| object-action-design | I turn red            |
| action-object        | Create something      |
| action-object-design | Create something fast |

You separate each of these things by adding the suffix to the head of
the phrase.
