## Welcome

ChatSurf is an open source language website where you can:

- Publish your conlang or natural language
- Publish a language's vocabulary
- Publish a language's grammar
- Publish word lists
- Publish your conscript or other writing system

It's basically like Wiktionary but with a different bar for quality, a more integrated and helpful UI (with various tools and such), an API for developers to use, and easier for others to contribute to (assuming you are familiar with Git/GitHub). And of course we would welcome all conlangs which Wiktionary probably won't support.

You'll also be able to:

- Download a PDF of your grammar.
- Download a spreadsheet of your dictionary entries and word lists.

## Development

```bash
# Start the local server
pnpm host

# Build the production build
pnpm make
```
