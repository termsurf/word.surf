bram (create experience)
bram kiq (create action) = brami
bram kaq (creation object) = brama
bram kuq (creative feature) = bramu
kiq bram kuq (creative action feature) kiqyabramu
kaq bram kuq (creative object feature)
bram zek kaq = bramyazeka
kiq kaq
kaq kaq

systematic system structure feature

Car+man+kuq (other-minded)
```

```
So there is the base form

- creator (action provider)
- create (do action)
- recreate (do action again)
- experience (6,000)
  - object (anger)
  - action (to anger)
  - feature
  - action as object (gerund)
  - action feature (kiq hagu, angrily)
  - object feature (kaq hagu, angry)
  - be angered (have state)
  - be angry (have feature)
  - x process
  - x provider
  - x receiver
  - x result
  - x period (child period = childhood)
  - object place (medicine store = pharmacy)
  - x ability
  - x ability feature (-able)
  - experience action feature
  - many x
  - possessive x agent

Experience is divided into action, object, and feature.

language_experience
  entry

language_notion
  experience
  variant (process, agent, etc.)

This system defines what are extensions of a base term. Extensions are different from compounds.

But it can go both ways:

- creation provider
- provider creation

So which is the base? Each term in Tune is a part of the base. An array of experiences chained together.

language_experience_chain
  id

language_experience_link
  base
  chain

language_experience
  tune
  english

language_entry
